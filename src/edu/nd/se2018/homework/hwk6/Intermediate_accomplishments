This is my first update on the Chip's Challenge game. Here are some of the features I have implemented so far and are in progress.
- Basic map tiles and blocks
- Chip's movement with updated images
- Random key position and color generation specified by user input in initial level 1 map
- Creation of level strategy interface with 2 levels
- Working on creating doors and exit for level 1
- Working on being able to store which keys are picked up which corresponds to what door
- Working on creating chips
